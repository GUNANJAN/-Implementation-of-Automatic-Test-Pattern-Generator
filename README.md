# Implementation-of-Automatic-Test-Pattern-Generator
 Implementation of Automatic Test Pattern Generator <br />
− Implemented PODEM algorithm for combinational test vector generation for single stuck-at-fault model. <br />
− Utilized path sensitization and decision-making techniques to generate effective test patterns. <br />
− Implemented logic simulator enabling accurate. fault simulation and verification of generated test patterns. <br />
