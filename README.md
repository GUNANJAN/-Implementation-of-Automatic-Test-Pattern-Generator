# -Implementation-of-Automatic-Test-Pattern-Generator
 Implementation of Automatic Test Pattern Generator 
− Implemented PODEM algorithm for combinational test vector generation for single stuck-at-fault model.
− Utilized path sensitization and decision-making techniques to generate effective test patterns.
− Implemented logic simulator enabling accurate. fault simulation and verification of generated test patterns.
